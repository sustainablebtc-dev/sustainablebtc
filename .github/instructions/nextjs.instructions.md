# Next.js 16 Instructions

## Scope

Apply to App Router routes, layouts, loading states, metadata, route handlers, server actions, and component boundaries.

## Rules

1. Use App Router patterns only.
2. Prefer server components.
3. Add `use client` only when browser-only behavior is necessary.
4. Keep route segments meaningful and stable.
5. Use route-local metadata exports where possible.
6. Treat route handlers and server actions as explicit server boundaries.
7. Avoid mixing server-only modules into client components.

## Routing Guidance

- place route files under `app/`
- colocate route-specific components only when they are not broadly reusable
- use nested layouts to share structure intentionally
- add `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, or `not-found.tsx` only when the route behavior warrants them

## Data and Rendering Guidance

- fetch on the server by default
- stream or defer only when it improves user experience
- avoid converting whole routes to client components because one widget needs interactivity
- keep cache strategy intentional and documented for data-bound surfaces

## Metadata Guidance

- set titles and descriptions per route
- keep metadata aligned with actual on-page content
- use structured data only when supported by visible content

## Boundary Checks

- no secrets in client code
- no unnecessary browser hooks in server components
- no server imports leaking into client bundles

## Image and Link Rules

### Images

- Always use `next/image` (`<Image>`) for all image elements.
- Never use raw `<img>` tags.
- Provide explicit `width` and `height` props, or use `fill` with a positioned container.
- Set `priority` on above-the-fold images (hero, LCP candidates).

### Links

- Use `next/link` (`<Link>`) for **internal** links — any href that stays on the same origin (`harvestt.com`).
- Use a plain `<a>` tag for **external** links — any href pointing to a different domain.
- External links must always include `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

```tsx
// ✅ Internal link
import Link from 'next/link'
<Link href="/about">About</Link>

// ✅ External link
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">External</a>

// ❌ Wrong — next/link for external URL
<Link href="https://example.com">External</Link>

// ❌ Wrong — plain anchor for internal route
<a href="/about">About</a>
```

## Delivery Checklist

- route structure correct
- server/client boundaries justified
- metadata included or explicitly deferred
- loading and error behavior considered
- no outdated Pages Router patterns introduced
- all images use `next/image`
- internal links use `next/link`, external links use `<a>` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
