Through expert-led discussions and interactive exhibits, SBP demonstrated Bitcoin's environmental impact and its role in advancing the global energy transition. By emphasizing the percentage of bitcoin mining done with renewable energy, SBP demonstrated how bitcoin mining can serve as a key driver for expanding renewable energy infrastructure. This innovative approach captured the attention of global climate investors managing over $3 trillion in AUM. SBP led critical conversations with sustainable finance leaders. Co-sponsoring the prestigious Sustainable Investment Forum alongside publicly traded Bitcoin miner MARA, SBP reinforced its commitment to aligning bitcoin mining's environmental impact with a renewable energy future. The Forum, hosted by Climate Action and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), brought together key decision-makers, including Norges Bank Investment Management, the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), S&P Global and other influential organizations. ▶️ Watch Bitcoin's Role in the Clean Energy Transition Sustainable Investment Forum 2024 Recent Posts 🚀 SBP's Bitcoin &",

    "text": "Executive Summary: Clean Energy Bitcoin Trust Executive Summary Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP) proposes the launch of a Clean Energy Bitcoin Trust, a pioneering private investment vehicle designed to offer institutional and accredited investors direct exposure to physically backed Bitcoin with integrated, verifiable clean energy credentials WITHOUT compromising on returns By holding both Bitcoin (BTC) and SBP tokens (a verifiable \"Proof-of-Clean-Work\" asset), this Trust positions itself as the first financial product to inextricably link digital asset adoption with the financing of the energy transition. This structure solves the \"energy critique\" of Bitcoin while offering a differentiated, risk-adjusted product for modern portfolios. Strategic Rationale: Why Now? The timing for a Clean Energy Bitcoin Trust is critical, driven by a convergence of political shifts in the U.S. and evolving market demands. The Political & Regulatory Pivot As the U.S. political landscape shifts toward a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets, the industry is poised for rapid institutional expansion. However, energy consumption remains a significant barrier to entry for capital and investors with climate mandates. Regardless of the administration, \"energy independence\" and \"grid stability\" are bipartisan priorities. A Trust that proves Bitcoin is incentivizing clean energy infrastructure aligns with both progressive environmental goals",

    "text": "climate mandates. Regardless of the administration, \"energy independence\" and \"grid stability\" are bipartisan priorities. A Trust that proves Bitcoin is incentivizing clean energy infrastructure aligns with both progressive environmental goals and conservative energy independence narratives. Why a Trust structure suits this moment: Inclusive Access: While ETFs are popular, a Trust structure (offered via private placement) allows for faster speed-to-market for accredited investors, family offices, and institutions who are currently sidelined by internal ESG mandates. As we get liquidity in the SBP token, the Trust can convert to an ETF at a later date. Yield Potential: Unlike current ETFs, a Trust structure offers greater flexibility to explore Bitcoin Staking options (as noted in product design), potentially activating yield without the strict regulatory constraints of a public ETF. Differentiation: As standard Bitcoin ETFs become commoditized \"fee races,\" this Trust offers a distinct value proposition: Bitcoin + Sustainability + Potential Yield. Target Investor Profiles Despite the political narrative shift in the U.S., a significant bifurcation has emerged in the capital markets. While some generalists retreat from \"ESG\" labels, fiduciary stewards of capital (pensions, endowments, and next-gen wealth) are actively doubling down on climate risk management and energy transition data.

Institutional Portfolios with Climate Mandates (The \"Fiduciary Holdouts\") Who they are: Major public pension funds (e.g., CalPERS, NYS Common Retirement Fund) and university endowments that have publicly maintained their decarbonization targets for 2030/2040, regardless of federal policy changes. The Problem: These entities face a \"Scope 3 emissions\" deadlock. They want the non-correlated returns of Bitcoin but cannot justify holding an asset often criticized for its carbon footprint without violating their own bylaws or stakeholder promises. The Trust Solution: This product offers them a \"regulatory shield.\" By holding the Trust, they can report line-item proof that their specific Bitcoin allocation is net-carbon-neutral (or carbon-negative) via the SBP token mechanism, satisfying risk committees and beneficiary boards simultaneously. 2.

They view the SBP token as a \"vote\" for a cleaner mining standard. The Trust structure also appeals to their desire for potential yield (via staking) which vanilla ETFs currently cannot legally offer. Why this matters now (The \"Energy Independence\" Pivot) Even for investors backing away from \"ESG,\" this product aligns with the new \"Energy Independence\" political narrative in the U.S. For the Right: It supports U.S. energy dominance and grid resilience (Bitcoin mining as a grid balancer).

Climate and energy transition investors are being forced to adapt quickly, rebalancing their funds from purely values-based to a greater focus on returns and adjusting their language to avoid the whims of politicians. For the past three years, Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP) has been building for the future of energy transition investing. Our thesis has always been that Bitcoin and digital assets can be a leader in energy transition investing and have the potential to be the best opportunity of the decade for energy transition-focused investors worldwide. Bitcoin as a network buys more than 20+ Gigawatts of energy globally each year (about half the UAE's total electricity supply) and the demand is growing rapidly. This presents a unique opportunity for SBP to build the future of climate investing powered by Bitcoin here in the UAE. SBP is a pioneer at the intersection of digital assets, proof of work consensus, and energy transition finance. What drove you to join the startup world? My desire",

My desire to be an entrepreneur has been with me since I was very young. As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to bend the rules. As an expat in Asia working in the corporate world I supported large retail brands to develop responsible supply chains and constantly craved to build and create things. While living in Vietnam, I invested in my friend's hospitality group and spent my nights and weekends helping them build, literally hanging art myself, sourcing equipment, etc. It never felt like work—it was passion. Yet, we achieved great financial success and earned numerous accolades. For nearly a decade, I worked in a leadership role in sustainability at a NYSE-listed conglomerate. In my personal time, I was constantly learning about and investing in digital assets and believed they were about to completely reshape traditional finance. I believed that Bitcoin and digital assets can transform not only traditional finance but also energy transition investing, and recognized an opportunity to pioneer an entirely new environmental asset tailored specifically",

The Middle East, particularly Abu Dhabi, is emerging as a global hub for digital asset innovation and climate finance, offering robust regulatory frameworks, visionary leadership, and an ecosystem that proactively supports startups. Being accepted into the Hub71 tech ecosystem solidified our decision to make Abu Dhabi our strategic home, allowing us access to exceptional talent and networks aligned with our growth objectives. My co-founder was previously living in Hong Kong and I was in New York, with the rest of the team fully remote around the world.

The Bitcoin Whitepaper was published at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Today we face another global crisis that Bitcoin has the potential to help solve, climate change. However, at present, Bitcoin miners need to be incentivized to use clean energy, posing a challenge in aligning with the growing demand from institutional investors for environmentally responsible investments. Both bitcoin miners and bitcoin investors lack a direct mechanism to support clean energy bitcoin mining —until now. SBP bridges this gap, making clean energy not just an option but a sustainable and profitable strategy for the future of Bitcoin mining and renewable-powered infrastructure. Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP) innovatively enhances the Bitcoin ecosystem without altering its fundamental workings. By building upon Bitcoin's existing data structures, SBP harnesses the environmental externalities of Bitcoin mining, channeling them toward positive climate impact. This is achieved by creating Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol tokens (SBPs), which validate and incentivize the use of renewable and clean energy in mining. Moreover, SBP drives a self-reinforcing cycle of clean energy financing: SBP fosters the creation of additional SBPs by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates",

Moreover, SBP drives a self-reinforcing cycle of clean energy financing: SBP fosters the creation of additional SBPs by purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and other Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) corresponding to the Bitcoin network's current-day's energy use; this creates a flywheel effect where the more energy the Bitcoin network uses, the more financing of renewable energy is required to create an SBP token, aligning real-time network consumption with positive environmental benefits. SBP thus emerges as a complementary layer, reinforcing Bitcoin's robustness while steering its energy narrative towards sustainability, proving that Bitcoin's growth can coexist with environmental responsibility. Introduction As the world's first energy-native digital asset class (derived from energy and computation), Bitcoin has a unique potential for sustainability and transparency. As a highly flexible energy buyer, Bitcoin mining can adapt to the availability of clean energy, pause operations without systemic risk for exceptional demand response, and operate in diverse locations, making it ideal for harnessing otherwise wasted energy sources like curtailed renewables. SBP enhances this incentive to utilize clean energy by enabling bottom-up, transparent accounting that imbues the voluntary decision to procure clean power with transferable economic value.

A Pioneering Environmental Commodity Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol tokens (SBPs) are a novel incentive for miners using verifiable clean energy, fostering a transparent, verified, and data-rich picture of Bitcoin's energy consumption. SBP tokens not only reward sustainable energy use but also amass a detailed dataset, illuminating the environmental footprint and benefits of Bitcoin mining. This data empowers investors to directly support Bitcoin's positive ecological contributions, bridging the gap between clean energy mining operations and institutional investment. SBP tokens functions as an environmental asset and are expected to gain financial value as their production difficulty escalates.

Like Bitcoin itself, there is a cap of 21 million SBP tokens, exclusively generated through measured environmental benefits. SBP tokens are only created from positive environmental impacts, and therefore, there are no tokenomics or pre-allocations. This represents a groundbreaking environmental commodity, unique in its creation and potential for positive change, a true Proof of Clean Work asset. Proof of Clean Work SBP tokens are only created from one of two measured environmental impacts: clean energy Bitcoin mining and the financing of renewable energy, equating to the present-day network's energy consumption. Therefore, the theoretical value of each Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol token (SBP) is anchored in the verified clean energy contributed by participating miners as well as the data derived from directing capital into clean energy markets. This process not only fosters the growth of sustainable energy sources but also ensures that the SBP tokens' worth is deeply intertwined with the clean energy markets.

This digital record is immutable and fully auditable, ensuring that all stakeholders can verify the integrity and environmental contribution of each SBP. SBP Value and Supply Creation SBP tokens are issued to miners who use verified clean energy. However, because there are currently less than 1.6 million coinbase rewards left to be mined between today and around 2140, the protocol would face a token supply challenge such that there will never be enough depth and liquidity to meet the demands of institutional investors. By solving this supply problem, an opportunity is created. For additional SBP beyond what is issued to BTC miners, SBPs are created when dollars are invested into RECs or other EACs, equivalent to the Bitcoin network's current energy consumption. For example, if the network currently requires 500 MWh to mine a single bitcoin on average, the protocol purchases and retires 500 MWh of high quality EACs on behalf of the historical footprint of the network, and mints an SBP",

As an example, the cost to create one Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol token (SBP) can be expressed as follows: Per-Bitcoin average energy consumption = X MWh Protocol purchases = X MWh of high-quality EACs Average price of high-quality EAC = $Y Cost to create or intrinsic value of an SBP = X MWh x $Y/MWh Example: At present, X = 500MWh and Y = $3, so intrinsic SBP price is $1,500 Thus, the foundational cost of an SBP token is directly linked to the amount invested in clean energy, pegging its value to the energy requirements of the Bitcoin network. To illustrate this further, if three years from now, the Bitcoin network is consuming 900 MWh to mine a single BTC, the cost to create an SBP will equal 900 MWh x $3, or $2700 without factoring a likely increase in EAC prices.

We consider the above formula the theoretical value of an SBP token, derived from the clean energy markets and the Bitcoin network's energy consumption. This means that the minimum value of an SBP earned by a miner should also equal the cost price to create an SBP, rooting the value of the SBP firmly in the clean energy markets and directly tied to Bitcoin's energy consumption. This also means that the \"difficulty\" or cost to produce an SBP is directly tied to the Bitcoin network's energy consumption. Therefore, as the Bitcoin network consumes increasingly more energy, the cost to create an SBP token will increase, meaning more capital is flowing to clean energy projects. In effect, the SBP is a climate financing flywheel derived from the Bitcoin network.

The first 17 million Bitcoin to be mined between the Genesis block and April 2018 consumed on average 4 kWh. As of the writing of this whitepaper, mining a single Bitcoin requires 502 MWh, a 12,500,000% increase. SBP tokens that are not earned by a miner are created from financing the same amount of clean energy required to sustainably mine a Bitcoin in the present day; therefore, each SBP token immeasurably overcompensates for the energy consumption of each BTC. For example, an SBP created today can be paired with any of the first 17 million BTC and overcompensate by more than 12 million percent. An SBP minted at any point in the future will always overcompensate for a BTC that was mined today.

SBP allows the holder to directly support the clean energy transition while owning Bitcoin. The end effect of establishing the SBP token as a clean energy complement to BTC means that as the network grows, the aforementioned climate-positive flywheel only grows stronger. Clean Energy and Transparency As noted in the introduction, Bitcoin mining is a novel buyer of energy and therefore requires a unique framework to account for its clean energy usage; however, there is simply no need to fully reinvent the wheel.

Details of the above noted requirements can be found in the Appendix. Bitcoin Mining Rewards and SBP Issuance To determine how many SBP a miner has earned, the protocol monitors their Bitcoin rewards directly from a mining pools API which must be voluntarily connected by the miner. For example, if the miner has earned 100 Bitcoin during the period of January 1st-31st, and their energy consumption data for that same period is 100% renewable, the miner will earn 100 SBP. If the miner has been verified to use 80% clean energy during the same time frame, they will receive 80 SBP, truncated to 8 decimal places. Miners are rewarded with SBPs for the total BTC mined for the period inclusive of transaction fees. We believe that transaction fees will start playing a more pivotal role in the total reward structure for miners over time and for that reason, we maintain a hard floor of 20% of total SBP issuance reserved for our mining partners with a potential",

So, for every 1 SBP issued to miners as a Protocol of verified clean work, we will on average be financing 3-4 SBP's worth in the clean energy markets thereby giving the SBP credibility as a claim to matching or exceeding Bitcoin energy consumption in perpetuity. BTC and SBP Fungibility One of Bitcoin's core value propositions is its fungibility, not only in terms of its economic value but its environmental footprint as well. Despite the genesis block requiring less than 15 kWh of energy to be mined and the current block requiring nearly 500 MWh, a more than a 3,000,000 percent increase, every Bitcoin that exists importantly shares the exact same environmental footprint.

Any sustainability solution for the asset class must recognize this critical facet, and therefore it is not possible for any individual Bitcoin to be characterized as \"green\" or \"non-green\", as they all share the exact same impact. Similarly, SBP is a fully fungible environmental commodity that is designed for Bitcoin. Each SBP or Kyoto that is produced represents that one BTC or Satoshi could have been mined in a carbon neutral or negative manner. All Bitcoins are interchangeable because every unit represents the exact same store of value, so it is therefore possible to decouple the sustainability attributes from Bitcoin and recouple it with a different Bitcoin, ultimately, the sustainability benefits are not lost but transferred.

SBP requires miners to meet the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidelines in order to receive SBP, which is the global standardized accounting framework for corporate clean energy procurement. This follows market-based accounting standards that use contractual instruments known as Energy Attribute Protocol s (EACs), which can take the form of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), Guarantees of Origin (GOs), or International Renewable Energy Protocol s (I-RECs) - that represent the environmental attributes for a MWh of clean energy generation.

To be clear, miners who make location-based claims are not 'unsustainable', they simply cannot make claims of clean energy use in line with other industries. This is because the green attributes associated with the power that they consume could have been sold to another party (e.g. you are mining at a hydropower plant but the Renewable Energy Protocol s (RECs) associated with that power are sold to another company). Bitcoin miners are able to make verifiable clean energy claims and receive SBP so long as they meet minimum GHG Protocol requirements through actions such as: Procuring EACs such as RECs, Guarantees of Origin (GOs), or I-RECs Green Tariffs, whereby a power provider retires EACs on behalf of the Bitcoin mining customer Physical and Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which are contracts with a power producer that enable organizations to purchase electricity directly from clean energy",

The $306 billion New York City (NYC) pension stack serves as a powerful domestic example of climate mandates compelling capital reallocation. This paper clearly demonstrates that SI is a massive, non-negotiable capital pool extending globally, and that the launch of a Clean Energy Bitcoin Trust represents a First-Mover Advantage that will significantly diversify the issuer's product range and unlock new capital flows currently blocked from the asset class due to sustainability mandates. Global Enforcement of Sustainable Mandates I. The $Trillion Enforcement: Quantifying Global Fiduciary Pressure The most compelling evidence of Sustainable Investing's relevance is the financial consequence of non-compliance. Global pension funds and institutional investors, bound by fiduciary duty, are actively enforcing climate and sustainability requirements through massive capital shifts. High-Value Global Mandate Shifts (2025) Mandate terminations in 2025 demonstrate the global scale of this capital pressure: PFZW (Dutch): The Dutch fund PFZW pulled $34 billion in mandates from major firms, including BlackRock and LGIM, specifically to improve its Paris Alignment score.

People's Pension (UK): The UK's People's Pension reallocated over $25 billion from State Street after the manager failed to meet evolving sustainability and stewardship expectations. NYC Comptroller (U.S.): The NYC Comptroller's office recommended dropping mandates for firms managing the $306 billion pension system, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and PanAgora, due to inadequate decarbonization plans. These actions clearly demonstrate that sustainable requirements dictate capital flows, establishing non-negotiable factors for this global capital pool. This pressure is also being exerted on university endowments and charitable funds nationwide. II. Political Headwinds and Climate Enforcement Models The perception of a decline or \"slowdown\" in sustainable investing has been driven by political turbulence, which has increased caution among asset managers but is failing to stop capital flows. This external uncertainty, however, is being countered by the strengthening of local enforcement models and regulatory certainty. Institutional Caution Meets Regulatory and Political Enforcement Major asset managers acknowledge that this political turbulence is their top concern: However, respondents in this year's survey were also more likely to highlight concerns regarding sustainable investing than in 2024...

Investors ranked data availability, fluctuating regulatory guidance and an uncertain political environment as their most significant concerns. (Source: Morgan Stanley Sustainable Signals Report 2025). This friction is precisely where compliance-driven products find their mandate: The Blue Capital Stack (U.S. Focus): This term refers to large, politically and reputationally sensitive pools of money, which form a national stack totaling over $2.1 trillion in the top state pension systems alone. Examples include the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS, ~$542 billion), the New York State Common Retirement Fund ($275 billion), and the NYC pension system. The victory of Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 New York City mayoral race reinforced this model, placing a progressive leader at the helm to directly demand higher climate performance from asset managers across this sector. EU Regulatory Hardening: European political shifts in 2025 indicate a renewed focus on reinforcing the Net Zero transition through industrial policy.

The evidence suggests that while political volatility creates market noise, the fundamental drivers - fiduciary mandates, legal requirements, and the political will in the major financial hubs, remain firmly focused on sustainable outcomes. The Clean Energy Bitcoin Trust: A Catalyst for Inflows III. Bridging Disruptive Technology and Sustainable Capital A core obstacle preventing large-scale institutional inflows into Bitcoin is its perceived energy footprint. The regulatory and political backdrop, combined with strict sustainability mandates, is creating a massive barrier, blocking the potential for hundreds of billions of dollars from entering the digital asset space. A Clean Energy Bitcoin Trust is positioned as the key financial innovation required to resolve this conflict and unlock institutional sustainable capital.

    "text": "The Natural Pricing of SBP: Anchored to the REC Market The Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol Token (SBP) is a groundbreaking environmental commodity specifically designed to align Bitcoin mining with the global clean energy transition. SBPs drive positive environmental impact in Bitcoin mining by ensuring miners have a financial mechanism to match their energy consumption with clean energy instruments like Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). This approach bridges Bitcoin mining with the $12.5 billion U.S. voluntary REC market, providing a scalable path to climate-positive Bitcoin. How the SBP Price is Derived: Energy Consumption Per Bitcoin:The Bitcoin network's current daily energy consumption per mined Bitcoin serves as the baseline metric. This figure is updated every 24 hours, reflecting the network's real-time energy use. Example (Today): If the network requires 1,000 MWh per Bitcoin, the SBP price is derived from this figure. Future Example: If six months from now, the network's energy consumption rises to 1,500 MWh per Bitcoin, the SBP price adjusts accordingly, ensuring it remains reflective of real-time conditions. Cost of High-Quality RECs:High-quality RECs, such as Green-e certified credits, are used as the benchmark for clean energy costs. These typically range up to $3 per MWh for the highest quality options. Formula for",

    "text": "RECs, such as Green-e certified credits, are used as the benchmark for clean energy costs. These typically range up to $3 per MWh for the highest quality options. Formula for SBP Price:SBP price = (BTC network's energy consumption per Bitcoin) × (cost per MWh for RECs) Using 1,000 MWh at $3 per MWh, the SBP price is $3,000. If the network's energy consumption rises to 1,500 MWh per Bitcoin, the SBP price adjusts to $4,500. Investor Upside Potential: Investors who purchase SBPs at current energy consumption levels benefit from upward price appreciation as the Bitcoin network's energy consumption grows. For example: An SBP purchased today at $3,000 (based on 1,000 MWh per Bitcoin) could appreciate to $4,500 if the network's energy consumption increases to 1,500 MWh per Bitcoin in the future. This price dynamic ensures that early SBP holders capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy instruments in Bitcoin mining. The Role of SBP Pricing: Covers Miner Costs:The SBP price ensures miners can fully offset their energy usage with high-quality clean energy purchases.
